Polyploid Population Genetics - UBRP/DSA Summer 2024 @ University of Arizona

Scripts to simulate changes in gamete and genotype frequencies at a single locus for autotetraploids, allotetraploids, and segmental allotetraploids. 

Additionally, scripts using Matlab's symbolic toolbox to find equilibria points for gamete and genotype frequencies with an infinite population size.
